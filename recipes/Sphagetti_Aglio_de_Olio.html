                Â½ cup extra virgin olive oil
            </li>
            <li>
                1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
            </li>
            <li>
                Salt, to taste
            </li>
            <li>
                Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
            </li>
            <li>
                Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the spaghetti.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and sliced garlic. Cook until the garlic is golden brown, being careful not to burn it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add red pepper flakes and cook for an additional minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet and toss to coat in the garlic oil. If the pasta seems dry, add reserved pasta water a little at a time until desired consistency is reached.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season with salt and garnish with chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese if desired. Serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>

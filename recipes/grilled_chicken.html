    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Rosemary Lemon Grilled Chicken recipe is a delicious and easy way to prepare chicken on the grill. The chicken is marinated in a mixture of lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper, which infuses it with flavor and helps keep it moist and tender as it cooks. The chicken is then grilled until it is golden brown and cooked through, resulting in a juicy and flavorful dish that is perfect for a summer barbecue or a weeknight dinner.
